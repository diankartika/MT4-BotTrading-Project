# MT4-BotTrading-Project
This automated trading bot for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) uses the MACD strategy to execute trades for my final project in Algorithm and Data Structure. The Expert Advisor (EA) monitors the market, generates buy/sell signals, and executes trades based on predefined conditions, helping automate trading strategies and reduce manual intervention.
